 <div id="text">Anne Dawson Infrastructure and Engineering is based around the very in-demand aspects of civil engineering. This is a broad category of disciplines that are all intertwined and have an impact in all of our daily lives.
<ul>
<li>Traffic Design and Management: The flow and movement of vehicle traffic is an important key to how any city is able to operate. This is more than just street widths and traffic signals, it even includes elements tied to road construction and other traffic flow elements.</li>
<li>Architecture is more than just designing pretty buildings and amazing landscaping. It also requires an understanding of off-property sight lines and coordinating with adjacent properties.</li>
<li>Infrastructure is a lot of things that we do see, such as raised utility and powerlines, it also includes things that we donâ€™t see, such as wastewater, sewage, underground utilities, water delivery and more. When all the little details matter the most, those who choose this path are the unsung heroes that ensure everything runs now and in the future. </li>
