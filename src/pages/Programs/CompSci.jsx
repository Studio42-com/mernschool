The Software/Hardware Information Technology school offers a complete education across various disciplines in the computer, software, networking and informational education industry.
<ul>
<li>Software Engineering is one of the trending needs in this modern connected world thanks to the internet. If you want to develop simple apps to do specific functions or large, complicated data-centric manipulation for huge clients, our program will get you the skills and experience employers are looking for. From web apps, social media, e-commerce and even mobile apps, the opportunities are endless if you have the education to take you to where you want to be!</li>
<li>Network engineering is the discipline of keeping data moving around, quickly, effectively and securely. Networking goes beyond the LAN and WIFI, there is the WAN(Wide Area Network), VPN, VLAN’ing, mobile access, permanent-type circuits and more. Even with the gradual phasing out of PTSN technologies(POTS and PANS), having exposure to these technologies will allow for support of legacy and niche applications were other technologies aren’t available. Students become familiar with routers, switches, routing protocols and technologies through a thorough understanding of the OSI model and in-depth troubleshooting using diagnostic tools ranging from simple cables to in and out of band packet capture and analyzers.</li>
<li>Large networks need more than just a method of moving data around, it needs places to not only store data, it needs to be able to serve as well. Network Administrators keep the data available, providing the core of data-based network infrastructure, serving the data needs of the larger picture. Students become familiar with popular server platforms, including the Windows Server series, Linux, Unix and more. </li>
