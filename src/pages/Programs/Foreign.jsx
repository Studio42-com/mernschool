Global Foreign Year:
<p /><p />
Students interested in a true multi-cultural experience may wish to enter our Global Foreign Year program. These programs are highly recommended for our foreign language students, as well as any students looking to broaden their experience through a truly immersive over-seas experience. Most programs focus on single-country destinations, such as Japan, France, England, Germany and more. Others preferring a more varied experience can chose our “Destination Africa”, where you’ll spend 2 months in up to 6 pre-selected destinations in a year-long experience.
<p />
Students interested in our Global Foreign Year program are often individuals looking to become teachers in foreign languages and those aspiring in careers in politics.
